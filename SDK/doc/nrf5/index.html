<p>SDK Release Notes: </p>
<pre class="fragment">nRF5 SDK v17.0.2
------------------------
Release Date: September, 2020
 
This SDK release is a bug fix release replacing nRF5 SDK v17.0.0.
This version contains the latest MDK (v8.35.0) with a bug fix that properly handles errata
on future devices with unknown HW ID.
If you are using v17.0.0 for development, it is strongly recommended to switch to v17.0.2.
 
Highlights:
 
- Added support for version 7.2.0 of SoftDevices S112, S113, S132, and S140.
- Added workarounds for anomalies 211 and 223.
- Added new nrfx v1.8.6 with a new MDK.
  See 'Compatibility of SES projects'.

The following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
 
 - ARM: MDK-ARM version 5.25   
 - GCC: GCC ARM Embedded 9.2019q4.major
 - IAR: IAR Workbench 7.80.4
 - SES: SES 4.50


****
Compatibility of SES projects:

Updates and fixes in the MDK used by Segger Embedded Studio break backwards compatibility
with old SES project files.
To use old projects in combination with this version of the SDK (MDK),
make the following updates:

1. In the flash_placement.xml file:
   MemorySegment name must be changed from "RAM" to "RAM1":
   &lt;MemorySegment name="RAM1" start="$(RAM_PH_START)" size="$(RAM_PH_SIZE)"&gt;

2. In the .emProject file:
   In "linker_section_placements_segments" you must refer to "RAM1", replacing "RAM":
   linker_section_placements_segments="FLASH RX 0x0 0x100000;RAM1 RWX 0x20000000 0x40000"

*****
Note for IAR 8 users:
(Libraries for IAR 8 require wchar_t to be of size 32 bits while IAR 7 requires 16 bits).
  
To run a project using IAR 8, follow these intructions:
 1. Open the IAR project in IAR 8. The IAR workbench will automatically generate an IAR 8 compatible project file.
 2. If the project contains one of the precompiled libraries listed below, replace it
    with the IAR 8 compatible alternative (there are no projects targeting nRF51 in this SDK).
 3. Save the project.
 4. When building the project, you might get the warning: "The header file 'cmsis_iar.h' is obsolete and should not be used. [...]".
    - The problem is described in DevZone post: https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/31123/iar-ewarm-8-22-1-complains-about-cmsis_iar-h
      The solution is to remove all occurrences of #include &lt;cmsis_iar.h&gt;.
     
The affected libraries are:
 - micro-ecc crypto:
    - IAR7: Includes library located in the folder named “…_iar\…”.
    - IAR8: Switch to using the library from the folder named “…_armgcc\…”.
 - nrf_cc310, nrf_cc310_bl, and nrf_oberon:
    - IAR7: Link to a library where “short_wchar” is part of the folder name.
    - IAR8: Link to a library without “short_wchar” in the folder name.
 - Gazell, NFC Tag, and 802.15.4:
    - IAR7: Includes the library where the file name ends with “_iar”.
    - IAR8: Switch to using the library with similar file name that ends with “_gcc”.

*** New features
*****************
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 
- nrfx has been updated to version 1.8.6.
  For details, see .\modules\nrfx\changelog.md.

** DTM **

-  Added support for new commands added in Bluetooth Core Specification 5.1 and 5.2.
-  You can now use a vendor-specific command to control the output power on the nRF21540 PA/LNA chip at runtime.
 
*** Changes
***********
 
** Drivers and libraries **

- Radio Test Example:
  Updated the radio_test_init() implementation to enable calling it multiple times.
  Documented how to use the API from radio_test.h directly.

** USB **

- Added an optional workaround for anomaly 211.
  If `NRFX_USBD_USE_WORKAROUND_FOR_ANOMALY_211 = 1` is set,
  the USB stack will handle cases of waking up not preceeded by a resume signal.
  
- Added a workaround for anomaly 223 in nrfx_usbd.h.
  The workaround fixes a possible but unlikely case where USB might be in incorrect state after power-on.

- Implemented a bug fix on USB HID related to usage with MacOS.
  The USB stack has been fixed to update the HID report buffer when idle mode is set to a non-zero value.
  This fixes the issues with USB HID Composite Example on macOS devices.

*** Bug fixes
****************

** nrfx/MDK **

- Added a new nrfx version that includes a new MDK.
  The MDK contains a fix for an issue where it would not properly handle errata
  on future devices with unknown HW ID.
  The bug was introduced in nRF5 SDK v17.0.0.

** Proprietary **

- Enhanced ShockBurst library:
  - Fixed a bug in ESB PRX related to ACK payload.
    When there is only one ACK payload, it sends the same payload twice.

** Crypto **

- nrf_crypto:
  - Added nrf_oberon v3.0.6 with the following bug fixes:
    - Fixed alignment issues when wrapping SHA-1 and SHA-256 contexts inside other context types.
    - Added missing symbol for HKDF/HMAC using SHA-1.
  - Added extra parameter check in nrf_crypto_ecc_byte_order_invert to prevent undefined behavior
    when invalid input is given.

**  Bluetooth Low Energy **

- Fixed a potential variable overflow in the Queued Writes library.

*** Known Issues
****************
 
** General **
 
- The workaround for Anomaly 198 for nRF52840 SPIM3 peripheral
  that has been implemented in nrfx_spim cannot be used with a SoftDevice.
  Flag NRFX_SPIM3_NRF52840_ANOMALY_198_WORKAROUND_ENABLED must be set to zero.
  The workaround based on a dedicated RAM block for SPIM3 must be used instead.
   
- usbd_msc example has a limitation. With setting "APP_USBD_CONFIG_EVENT_QUEUE_ENABLE = 0", when USB
  cable is unplugged and re-plugged, the application goes into an endless loop.
  This is due to an issue in the unsupported block device library.
   
** BLE **
 
- GATTC: the ble_gattc_service_t::uuid field is incorrectly populated
  in the BLE_GATTC_EVT_PRIM_SRVC_DISC_RSP event if the
  sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover() or sd_ble_gattc_read()
  are called when a Primary Service Discovery by Service UUID is already ongoing.
  When the application has called sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover(),
  it should wait for the BLE_GATTC_EVT_PRIM_SRVC_DISC_RSP event before calling
  sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover() or sd_ble_gattc_read().
- The TFTP Background DFU example has known instabilities.
- BLE Interactive CLI example: the command to set a custom ATT MTU only takes
  effect on the subsequent connection and the updated MTU parameter is not
  maintained in further connections with the same peer, even when bonded.
- ANT Shared Channels example: when testing BLE connection with an Android device,
  the link is terminated by Android due to unhandled LL requests.
- Bluetooth ANCS example: when connected from iPhone and pressing DK buttons,
  the example may assert before the BLE link is authenticated.
 
   
** Crypto **
 
- The nrf_crypto CLI example may fail when using ecc private key converted
  from raw function for specific curve types.
 
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 
- The SAADC driver does not handle detection limits 'high' and 'low' correctly
  if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.
- USBD:
  - The library may handle Remote Wakeup incorrectly.
  - Issuing a SET_ADDRESS(0) request does not cause the device to change
    its state to default.
  - The device does not STALL when a DATA transaction is received outside of SETUP.
    It ACKs instead.
- LEDS_OFF, LEDS_ON, LED_IS_ON, LEDS_INVERT, LEDS_CONFIGURE macros defined in boards.h
  work only with pins on port 0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed an error in the code that booted the app, which could happen
  with certain optimization settings.
- Fixed a false positive assert that could sometimes happen after a reset
  during an upgrade.
- Fixed a bug that caused compilation errors when building with a board with no buttons.

** DTM **

- DTM reports regarding Max Octets are now correct for devices without long range support.

** USB **

- Fixed issues and optimized app_usbd_string_desc.
- Fixed issues in USB CLI backend when handling a port close.

** Proprietary **

- Gazell: fixed an assertion that would be sometimes generated after
  a packet transmission.
- ESB: fixed a bug in the nrf_esb_pop_tx function where packages would get sent anyway
  in certain situations.


*** Known Issues
****************

** General **

- The workaround for Anomaly 198 for nRF52840 SPIM3 peripheral
  that has been implemented in nrfx_spim cannot be used with a SoftDevice.
  Flag NRFX_SPIM3_NRF52840_ANOMALY_198_WORKAROUND_ENABLED must be set to zero.
  The workaround based on a dedicated RAM block for SPIM3 must be used instead.
- usbd_msc example has a limitation.
  With setting "APP_USBD_CONFIG_EVENT_QUEUE_ENABLE = 0",
  when USB cable is unplugged and re-plugged, the application goes into an endless loop.
  This is due to an issue in the unsupported block device library.

** Bluetooth Low Energy **

- GATTC: the ble_gattc_service_t::uuid field is incorrectly populated
  in the BLE_GATTC_EVT_PRIM_SRVC_DISC_RSP event if the
  sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover() or sd_ble_gattc_read()
  are called when a Primary Service Discovery by Service UUID is already ongoing.
  When the application has called sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover(),
  it should wait for the BLE_GATTC_EVT_PRIM_SRVC_DISC_RSP event before calling
  sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover() or sd_ble_gattc_read().
- BLE Interactive CLI example: the command to set a custom ATT MTU only takes
  effect on the subsequent connection and the updated MTU parameter is not
  maintained in further connections with the same peer, even when bonded.
- ANT Shared Channels example: when testing a Bluetooth Low Energy connection
  with an Android device, the link is terminated by Android due to unhandled LL requests.
- Bluetooth ANCS example: when connected from iPhone and pressing DK buttons,
  the example may assert before the Bluetooth Low Energy link is authenticated.


** Crypto **

- The nrf_crypto CLI example may fail when using an ECC private key converted
  from raw function for specific curve types.

** Drivers and libraries **

- The SAADC driver (from nrfx 1.8.x) does not handle detection limits 'high' and 'low'
  correctly if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.
  SAADC driver ported from nrfx 2.2.x is not affected by this.
- USBD:
  - The library may handle Remote Wakeup incorrectly.
  - Issuing a SET_ADDRESS(0) request does not cause the device to change
    its state to default.
  - The device does not STALL when a DATA transaction is received outside of SETUP.
    It ACKs instead.
- The following macros defined in boards.h work only with pins on port 0:
  - LEDS_OFF
  - LEDS_ON
  - LED_IS_ON
  - LEDS_INVERT
  - LEDS_CONFIGURE
- The low_power_pwm library does not correctly initialize GPIOs
  that are placed on PORT1 in the low_power_pwm_init function.
  This indirectly affects the led_softblink library and can also affect
  the DFU open bootloader.
